PersiaML is a distributed deep learning framework based on PyTorch to support
models with extremely high-dimensional features (over 10 trillion) and huge
model size (over 10TB). Such models are typically used in recommender systems
on tasks like CTR prediction.

Benefiting from an innovative hybrid training design, PersiaML is [**very fast**](https://persiaml-tutorials.pages.dev/benchmark/), while
keeping the model accuracy nearly the same as a model trained synchronously.
